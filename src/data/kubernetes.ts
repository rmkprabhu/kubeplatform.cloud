To troubleshoot: check Pod logs for errors using 'kubectl logs <pod-name>'; describe the Pod with 'kubectl describe pod <pod-name>' to see events and container states; look for common issues like incorrect environment variables, failed dependencies, or misconfigurations in container commands or arguments.
